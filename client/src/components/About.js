            <p>
                From my very first line of code I wrote and made "Hello World" appear on my computer screen I knew I was hooked. It was at that moment I knew becoming a Software Engineer is what I wanted to pursue as a career. I've always been driven by this goal constantly learning and pushing myself to achieve my dream. I knew that entering the exciting field of Software not only future-proofs my career but allowed my potential to have no limits. I pursued a career as a Software Developer knowing I have the ability to impact the future by creating it.
